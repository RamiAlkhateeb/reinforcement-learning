<br/>

Gym is a library for reinforcement learning research. It provides us with a simple interface to a large number of tasks, including

- Classic control tasks (CartPole, Pendulum, MountainCar, etc)
- Classic video games (Space Invaders, Breakout, Pong, etc)
- Continuous control tasks
- Robotic arm manipulation

In this section we are going to get familiar with the five methods that we'll use while solving a control
task.
